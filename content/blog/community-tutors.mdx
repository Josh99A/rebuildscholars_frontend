# People who show up

Our volunteers are parents, educators, students, and neighbors. They show up week after week to build trust and learning momentum.

## How we support tutors

1. Weekly coaching circles
2. Lesson planning toolkits
3. On-site program leads

Tutors tell us they grow alongside the scholars they support.
