# Learning is a team sport

Families are essential partners in student success. Our Family Partnerships program equips caregivers with practical tools that fit busy schedules.

## What families receive

- Weekly learning routines
- Access to community resources
- Language-support materials

We work in multiple languages and partner with local organizations so families feel supported year-round.
